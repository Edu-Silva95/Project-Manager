A small project I made solo as challenge that was made by the tutor for "React - The Complete Guide 2025 (incl. Next.js, Redux)" - Udemy Course, fully working and styled.

This project I used only React, and Javascript Hooks to make it work. Styled with TailwindCSS. A challenging project since it was the first React project I made alone. I enjoyed working on this one!
Created a bit more than what I was asked, but I felt like I needed to make it detailed without going too much overboard, as there are lots of things that could get added to make it better!
